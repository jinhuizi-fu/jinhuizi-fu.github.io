      <description>Chausson composed Poème, a one movement violin-orchestra piece 3 years before he died. So beautiful, mysterious, and sexy, this is one of my favouite music ever.
His inspiration came from Ivan Turgenev’s novel, The Song of Triumphant Love. I spent an hour to read this novel one night. It is an interesting story. It’s about 2 friends, one of them a painter and the other a musician, fell in love with same woman.</description>

      <description>The Little Prince is one of my favorite books as a kid.
The writer meets a little prince when his plane crashed into Sahara, and the little prince is from a planet far away. He has a rose that he really loves and takes care of, while a fox wants to be tamed by him. These are the two little stories in the book that touches my heart the most.</description>
