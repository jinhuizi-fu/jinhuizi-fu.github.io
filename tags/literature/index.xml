      <description>Chausson composed Poème, a one movement violin-orchestra piece 3 years before he died. So beautiful, mysterious, and sexy, this is one of my favouite music ever.
His inspiration came from Ivan Turgenev’s novel, The Song of Triumphant Love. I spent an hour to read this novel one night. It is an interesting story. It’s about 2 friends, one of them a painter and the other a musician, fell in love with same woman.</description>
