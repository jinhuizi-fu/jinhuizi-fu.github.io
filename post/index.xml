      <description>Today I have great news: I married my best friend and the love of my life, Mr. Clayton White!
I’m so thrilled to begin our journey together and share every moment in our lives: the sweet love story from our past time together, the commitment on this very special day, and a lifetime of happiness in the future.
We will always support each other as friends, love each other as family, and loyal to each other as lovers.</description>

      <description>Chausson composed Poème, a one movement violin-orchestra piece 3 years before he died. So beautiful, mysterious, and sexy, this is one of my favouite music ever.
His inspiration came from Ivan Turgenev’s novel, The Song of Triumphant Love. I spent an hour to read this novel one night. It is an interesting story. It’s about 2 friends, one of them a painter and the other a musician, fell in love with same woman.</description>

      <description>In the last post, we discussed about the goal of this project (find out what makes a playlist successful), and sourced data through Spotify API. In this post, we will continue working towards this goal by building 2 models. After that, we’re going to look at the variable importance, as well as compare the methods.
Split Training and Testing Datasets Create training (80%) and test (20%) sets for the spotify_pl_feature_1 data.</description>

      <description>I already wrote two posts on Spotify analysis - one on the Beatles tracks and albums, and another one for my own listening habits. I had a lot of fun doing these exploratory data analysis, and I decide to make it a trilogy. In this new post, I’m going to take one step further: I want to find out what makes a playlist successful, and try to predict how successful a playlist will be based on its known features.</description>

      <description>I’ve just started to study a course on Coursera called “Buddhism and Modern Psychology”. I find it very interesting. The purpose of the course is not all about religion, but rather with the help of buddhism and modern psychology, how to find happiness and peace in life.
The first topic is about the 4 noble truths:
the truth of suffering the cause of suffering the cessation of suffering the Noble Eightfold Path  Here are some points from the course that I find interesting:</description>

      <title>Spotify Analysis 2 - Music I listen To</title>

      <description>In my last post, I downloaded the track features of the Beatles’ songs from Spotify web API, and did some basic mining on it. We looked at the keys the Beatles used most, happiest songs, most danceable songs, the distribution of happiness and liveness of each album. It was fun stuff!
In this new post, I’m going to explore a little more. Not the Beatles though, today I’m going to take a look at my own listening habits!</description>

      <title>Spotify Analysis 1 - the Beatles</title>

      <description>I absolutely love music! Spotify is my go-to app when I want to enjoy some listening. As someone who’s passionate about mining data and discover the story underneath, what’s great is that for each song, Spotify stores a list of its features such as acousticness, danceability, energy and more. Also, thanks to the {spotifyr} package by Charlie Thompson, we can easily use a web API by Spotify from which I can download very interesting data and play with it.</description>

      <title>Some thoughts after reading the Little Prince</title>

      <description>The Little Prince is one of my favorite books as a kid.
The writer meets a little prince when his plane crashed into Sahara, and the little prince is from a planet far away. He has a rose that he really loves and takes care of, while a fox wants to be tamed by him. These are the two little stories in the book that touches my heart the most.</description>
